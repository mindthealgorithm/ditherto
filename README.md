# ditherto

Dither images into a fixed palette, with optional resizing and tone adjustments. A TypeScript library for browsers, workers and Node, with a small PNG CLI and interactive examples.

Three algorithms: **Atkinson**, **Floyd–Steinberg**, and deterministic **4×4 Bayer ordered dithering**. Bring your own palette or use black/white, monochrome red/green/blue/yellow, Game Boy, CGA, RGB, or 16-level grayscale.

**One image, a whole page, or a folder of assets.** Choose a shared palette and algorithm, then tune each image's exposure and contrast. The pixel API keeps original dimensions by default; responsive browser bindings automatically follow the layout. No framework required.

## Try it

Open either playground above—no account or installation. Images stay on your device. The image playground exports PNGs, JavaScript and a matching CLI command. The Arcana site includes five tarot studies, Amber/Orchid/Moss themes, and live rendering from the originals as the layout changes. The responsive gallery demonstrates independent image settings, automatic rerendering, and restoring originals.

Install the library in your project:

```sh
npm install ditherto
```

Or run the CLI directly:

```sh
npx ditherto photo.jpg -o photo.png --palette MONO_BLUE
```

Node 20 or newer is required for the CLI and build tools. To develop locally or run the playgrounds from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jcinis/ditherto.git
cd ditherto
npm ci
npm run build
node dist/cli.js photo.jpg -o photo.png --palette MONO_BLUE
npm run demo
```

The last command starts a local server at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`; the homepage is at `/index.html`. For a local package you can install into another project, run `npm pack`, then `npm install /path/to/ditherto-0.1.0.tgz` in that project.

See the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ditherto) and [release procedure](https://github.com/jcinis/ditherto/blob/main/docs/RELEASING.md).

## CLI for people and agents

A command takes one source file and writes one PNG. No resize is required:

```sh
npx ditherto photo.jpg -o photo.png --palette MONO_BLUE
```

Create a small web asset, reuse an art-directed palette, and get a machine-readable result:

```sh
npx ditherto photo.jpg -o assets/photo.png \
  --palette '#25213b,#8b5066,#dda77b,#f4eccf' \
  --algorithm atkinson --width 320 --resample area \
  --exposure 0.3 --contrast 1.1 --json
```

```json
{"input":"photo.jpg","output":"assets/photo.png","width":320,"height":213}
```

The dimensions above illustrate a 3:2 input. `--json` writes one JSON object to stdout on success; failures write to stderr and exit with code 1. Success exits with code 0. Explicit output paths keep source files separate; an existing output file is overwritten. `--palette` accepts a built-in name (case-insensitive) or 1–256 comma-separated six-digit hex colors. Quote hex lists in your shell. Use `--paletteimg reference.jpg --palette-colors 8` to borrow colors from a photo instead; it cannot be combined with `--palette`.

A useful agent workflow is **render → inspect the PNG → adjust → retain the chosen settings**. Keep the original source for every candidate and give candidates different output names. For example, vary exposure while holding the palette and algorithm fixed:

```sh
# Bash / POSIX-style shell. Run against the original photo every time.
for exposure in -0.5 0 0.5; do
  npx ditherto photo.jpg -o "candidates/photo-ev${exposure}.png" \
    --palette GAMEBOY --algorithm atkinson \
    --width 240 --resample area --exposure "$exposure" --json
done
```

For fast batches, install once (`npm install --global ditherto`) and call `ditherto`, or use `node dist/cli.js` from the checkout. To avoid process startup for every file in a large batch, use the Node API in one process. There is no hidden auto-tuning: the caller chooses the look, and settings are explicit and reproducible for the same decoded pixels.

```sh
# Process a directory, preserving filenames and leaving originals intact.
for file in photos/*.jpg; do
  [ -f "$file" ] || continue
  name="${file##*/}"
  ditherto "$file" -o "out/${name%.*}.png" \
    --palette MONO_RED --width 320 --resample area --json
done
```

Run `node dist/cli.js --help` for all flags. The CLI supports PNG output and local input paths. For browser URLs, Blob inputs and custom algorithms, use the JavaScript API.

The algorithms share a black/white palette here. Atkinson discards part of the error for a more open texture; Floyd–Steinberg distributes it across neighboring pixels; Bayer uses a repeating threshold grid.

## Browser

For images on a page, let your CSS layout determine the display size. **No `width` or `height` option is required.** The responsive helper follows each image wrapper's content width and rerenders from the original whenever that width changes.

```html
<div class="photo">
  <img class="dither" src="photo.jpg" alt="A mountain landscape">
</div>
```

```ts
import { observeDitherDOM, PALETTES } from 'ditherto/dom';

const images = observeDitherDOM('img.dither', {
  algorithm: 'atkinson',
  palette: PALETTES.GAMEBOY,
  resample: 'area', // Average photo detail when fitting the display size
});

await images.ready;
// On unmount, stop observing and restore the original image elements:
// images.destroy();
```

Give each image its own wrapper sized by your layout, such as a grid cell. The canvas fills that wrapper and retains the source aspect ratio. This helper follows wrapper width; it does not reproduce arbitrary image-specific fixed-height or cropped `object-fit` layouts. See [responsive images and per-image settings](#responsive-images-and-per-image-settings) for updates, cleanup and shared-worker rendering.

### Process pixels at the original size

The lower-level pixel API preserves the source image's native dimensions unless you explicitly supply `width` or `height`. It does not observe the DOM or infer display dimensions.

```ts
import { ditherToImageData, PALETTES } from 'ditherto/browser';

const originalImage = document.querySelector('img')!;
const pixels = await ditherToImageData(originalImage, {
  algorithm: 'atkinson',
  palette: PALETTES.GAMEBOY,
}); // Same pixel dimensions as the original image

const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')!;
canvas.width = pixels.width;
canvas.height = pixels.height;
canvas.getContext('2d')!.putImageData(pixels, 0, 0);
```

Use `ditherto/browser` with browser bundlers: its build contains no Node or native-canvas imports. For direct module imports, serve the built `dist/browser.js` alongside your application (or `dist/dom.js` for the responsive helper). The browser entry also accepts RGBA pixels or Blobs in module workers.

`ditherToImageData` waits for an image element to load. URL inputs require same-origin access or permission through CORS. For interactive controls, keep the original source and call the function again with new options; do not feed the previous dithered result back in. Large jobs are synchronous during the pixel-processing portion, so run them in a worker, as the playground does.

## Node (20+)

```ts
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { ditherToImageData, PALETTES } from 'ditherto';
import { encodePng } from 'ditherto/node';

const pixels = await ditherToImageData('./photo.jpg', {
  algorithm: 'floyd-steinberg',
  palette: PALETTES.GAMEBOY,
});
await writeFile('./photo.dithered.png', encodePng(pixels));
```

Omitting `width` and `height` preserves the source dimensions. Add either option only when you want to resize.

`@napi-rs/canvas` handles Node decoding and PNG encoding. PNG output retains dimensions and transparency. CommonJS `require('ditherto')` and `require('ditherto/node')` are also supported.

## API

### `ditherToImageData(input, options?)`

The preferred API returns `{ width, height, data, colorSpace }` in every runtime. `data` is a `Uint8ClampedArray` of **RGBA** pixels. In browsers and supported workers the result is a native `ImageData`; in Node it is an equivalent record. Inputs are never modified.

Accepted inputs:

- `ImageData` or an equivalent RGBA record.
- Browser `HTMLImageElement`, `Blob`, `File`, image URL, `ArrayBuffer` or `Uint8Array`.
- Node file path, HTTP(S) URL, `Buffer`, `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Blob` or `File`.

Decoded format support depends on the host browser or Node canvas decoder. Animated files are processed as a single decoded frame, not an animation.

| Option | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `algorithm` | `'atkinson'` | Built-in name or a registered custom algorithm |
| `palette` | `PALETTES.BW` | Readonly RGB triples, integer channels 0–255 |
| `paletteImg` | — | Palette swatch or reference photo; explicit `palette` takes precedence |
| `paletteColors` | — | Quantize `paletteImg` to at most 1–256 representative colors; omitted means exact extraction |
| `width`, `height` | Omitted: no resizing | Optional positive integer bounds; preserve aspect ratio and fit inside both when supplied |
| `resample` | `'nearest'` | `'area'` averages source-pixel coverage when shrinking photos; both use nearest-neighbor enlargement |
| `step` | `1` | Positive integer pixel-block size; dimensions do not change |
| `exposure` | `0` | −4 to +4 photographic stops in linear sRGB, before dithering |
| `contrast` | `1` | 0–2 slope around the encoded sRGB midpoint; 1 is neutral |
| `quality` | — | Deprecated compatibility hint; validated but does **not** change pixels or PNG output |

**Resizing is optional.** With neither `width` nor `height`, the pipeline skips resampling and dithers at the original pixel dimensions. Setting `resample` alone does not change dimensions; it chooses the filter to use if resizing is requested. This is separate from `observeDitherDOM`, which automatically supplies dimensions from the page layout.

Explicit width/height options can upscale as well as downscale. Nearest-neighbor resizing samples pixel centers. Area resizing integrates each destination pixel’s exact source footprint, including fractional ratios, in encoded sRGB (not linear light). It weights colors by alpha before averaging, so invisible RGB cannot create colored fringes. Both filters are deterministic given the same decoded RGBA pixels; host decoders and color management may differ. The playground defaults to area; the library keeps nearest for compatibility. Extremely thin images retain a minimum dimension of one pixel. Decoded inputs and processed outputs are limited to 8192 pixels per side and 16,777,216 pixels total; these are allocation guards, not a decoder memory guarantee.

RGB matching uses squared Euclidean distance in encoded sRGB. Alpha is retained per pixel; fully transparent pixels do not spread error. Blocks sample the top-left visible pixel (the origin when visible) and fill RGB across the block while retaining each pixel's alpha.

### Monochrome defaults

Use `PALETTES.MONO_RED`, `PALETTES.MONO_GREEN`, `PALETTES.MONO_BLUE`, or `PALETTES.MONO_YELLOW` for a single colored ink on white. Each palette contains exactly two colors:

| Palette | Ink | Paper |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MONO_RED` | `#ff0000` | `#ffffff` |
| `MONO_GREEN` | `#00ff00` | `#ffffff` |
| `MONO_BLUE` | `#0000ff` | `#ffffff` |
| `MONO_YELLOW` | `#ffff00` | `#ffffff` |

```ts
const pixels = await ditherToImageData(originalImage, {
  palette: PALETTES.MONO_BLUE,
});
```

These are ordinary palettes, available from the main, browser and DOM entries, and work with all three algorithms. Both examples include them in the palette menu. They use the existing RGB color matching, with no grayscale conversion or extra effect. Bright green and yellow produce lighter marks on white; use a custom darker ink color if you want stronger contrast. Transparency is preserved, so white is a palette color rather than a background compositing operation.

### `ditherImage(input, options?)`

Compatibility API: returns `ImageData` in browsers/workers, but raw **RGB** `Uint8Array` bytes in Node. These bytes are **not** a PNG/JPEG and do not include dimensions or alpha. Prefer `ditherToImageData` for new integrations.

### `generatePalette(input, options?)`

For photographs, explicitly request a color budget:

```ts
import { generatePalette, ditherToImageData } from 'ditherto/browser';

const palette = await generatePalette(referencePhoto, { colors: 8 });
const pixels = await ditherToImageData(originalImage, {
  palette,
  width: 320,
  resample: 'area',
  exposure: 0.5, // Half a stop brighter
  contrast: 1.2, // 20% more contrast
});
```

Or use the shorthand `ditherToImageData(originalImage, { paletteImg: referencePhoto, paletteColors: 8 })`. Keep the generated palette to reuse it across size, tone and algorithm changes. The playground caches it in its worker and embeds the RGB values in the copied recipe.

`colors` is an integer from 1 to 256. Photo quantization uses deterministic, alpha-weighted median cut over a bounded 5-bit-per-channel RGB histogram. Frequent, opaque colors have more influence; invisible pixels are ignored. Output contains **up to** the requested number of unique colors, sorted dark to light. Small palettes already within the budget retain their exact colors. Similar histogram colors can merge; representative colors are weighted averages, not necessarily exact source pixels. A fully transparent photo produces a clear error.

Without `colors`, the existing exact-swatch behavior remains: extract all unique visible RGB colors, with a default `maxColors: 256` guard (configurable to 4096). Exceeding that guard rejects the image; it does not silently quantize. `colors` and `maxColors` cannot be combined.

### Exposure and contrast

The processing order is **resize → exposure → contrast → dither**. Exposure doubles linear-light intensity for each positive stop, using the sRGB transfer curve. Contrast changes the slope around encoded sRGB 0.5; the final RGB values are clipped to 0–255. The playground shows contrast as −100% to +100%, corresponding to API factors 0 to 2. Alpha is preserved. Neutral settings reproduce the prior pipeline exactly.

Adjustments affect the image being dithered, not the reference palette. Reset always starts from original pixels. This is an SDR adjustment, not RAW development or highlight recovery. Inputs are assumed to be decoded sRGB, as elsewhere in the pipeline.

### Shared style with per-image tuning

You can hold palette and algorithm constant while adjusting each image independently. This uses ordinary options; no special batch or agent runtime is required.

```ts
import { ditherToImageData, PALETTES, type DitherOptions } from 'ditherto/browser';

const style = {
  algorithm: 'atkinson',
  palette: PALETTES.GAMEBOY,
} satisfies Pick<DitherOptions, 'algorithm' | 'palette'>;

const tuning: Record<string, Pick<DitherOptions, 'exposure' | 'contrast'>> = {
  portrait: { exposure: 0.5, contrast: 1.1 },
  landscape: { exposure: -0.2, contrast: 1.25 },
};

const pixels = await ditherToImageData('/images/portrait.jpg', {
  width: 320,
  resample: 'area',
  ...tuning.portrait,
  ...style,
});
```

The values above illustrate configuration, not recommended settings for every portrait or landscape. A person or agent can render candidate adjustments from the original, inspect them at the intended display size, and save the chosen options. Keep the shared style fixed during that search when visual consistency is a requirement. Explicit palettes take precedence over palette-image extraction.

The same API supports browser, worker, server and build-time workflows. Callers control scheduling and caching. Determinism applies to identical decoded RGBA input and settings; host image decoders can differ.

### `algorithms.register(algorithm)`

```ts
import { algorithms } from 'ditherto';

algorithms.register({
  name: 'my-algorithm',
  apply(image, palette, step) {
    // Return an RGBA image record or ImageData.
    return image;
  },
});
```

The pipeline isolates input pixels before invoking plugins. `algorithms.list()` lists registered names. Palette order breaks nearest-color ties deterministically.

### One-shot DOM helpers

```html
<img class="dither" data-algorithm="ordered" src="photo.png" alt="A mountain landscape">
```

```ts
import { autoDitherDOM } from 'ditherto/browser';
const canvases = await autoDitherDOM('img.dither');
```

The helper waits for loading, replaces matching images with canvases, retains their accessible labels, and rejects on failure. `ditherImageElement(img, options)` processes one element. Palette and tone attributes are `data-palette-img`, `data-palette-colors`, `data-exposure`, and `data-contrast`. These are one-shot helpers: they keep the source pixel dimensions unless resize options or attributes are supplied, and they do not track later layout changes. For automatic display sizing, resize observation, independent updates and cleanup, use `observeDitherDOM` below. Explicit options override data attributes in the one-shot helpers.

## Responsive images and per-image settings

Import `ditherto/dom` when you want the library to manage image elements. **Omit `width` and `height` to render at the layout's current display width automatically.** It reexports the browser API and adds `observeDitherDOM`; importing it is safe during server rendering, but calling the helper requires a browser with `ResizeObserver`. The ordinary browser entry does not include this integration.

```html
<div class="photo"><img class="dither" src="portrait.jpg" alt="Portrait" data-exposure="0.4"></div>
<div class="photo"><img class="dither" src="landscape.jpg" alt="Landscape" data-contrast="1.2"></div>
```

```ts
import { observeDitherDOM, PALETTES } from 'ditherto/dom';

const gallery = observeDitherDOM('img.dither', {
  palette: PALETTES.GAMEBOY,
  algorithm: 'atkinson',
  resample: 'area',
}, {
  onError: (error, image) => console.error(image.src, error),
});

const results = await gallery.ready; // Promise.allSettled results, in selector order
await gallery.images[0].update({ exposure: 0.7 });
await gallery.images[0].update({ exposure: undefined }); // use the attribute/default again
// After changing the original src or attributes:
await gallery.images[0].refresh();
// On unmount: release pixels/observers and restore the same original nodes.
gallery.destroy();
```

The selector is a snapshot. Use `root` to scope it to a container or shadow root; bind newly inserted images separately. Settings are merged in this order: **shared defaults → image data attributes → `resolveOptions(image)` → `handle.update()` overrides**. A resolver can retrieve per-image settings from a saved manifest. `update()` merges changes; `undefined` removes an override. `refresh()` rereads source pixels and settings while retaining overrides. `gallery.refresh()` refreshes all bindings and returns settled results.

Give each image a dedicated wrapper with a width determined by your layout (for example, a grid cell). The canvas fills its parent's **content width**, retaining the image's aspect ratio. An optional `width`/`height` caps bitmap resolution, so a lower-resolution image can be displayed larger with crisp pixels. This helper does not reproduce arbitrary `object-fit`, crop, fixed-height or original image width rules. Bitmap resolution is in CSS pixels, independent of device pixel ratio. Renders always start from cached original pixels, never from an earlier dithered result. The cached source stays fixed across resizes; call `refresh()` after changing `src`, `srcset` or `<picture>` selection.

Each controller has one resize observer and a serial render queue. Updates are coalesced (default `debounceMs: 60`), and superseded calls resolve with the latest result. Initially hidden or disconnected wrappers resolve to `null`; a later observed width change schedules rendering. An unloaded image waits for its native load/error event without holding the queue, so native lazy loading can delay its `ready` result until it enters view. A failed image retains its original or last successful canvas; inspect `handle.error` or supply `onError`. Accessible labels are copied to the canvas. Event listeners on the original image resume when that same node is restored; interaction intended during dithering should be attached to the wrapper.

Call `handle.destroy()` for one image or `gallery.destroy()` for the group. Disposal rejects pending per-image calls with `AbortError`, releases cached pixels and prevents late results from painting. It does not stop computations already running in an injected renderer. DOM removal alone does not dispose a binding; framework integrations should call `destroy()` on unmount.

The default renderer runs on the calling thread, yielding between images. For expensive interactive processing, supply `render(source, options): Promise<ImageData>` backed by a worker. It receives an isolated pixel copy that may be transferred or modified. One worker can serve the whole group: see [the responsive gallery](https://jcinis.github.io/ditherto/responsive.html) and [its shared-worker wiring](https://github.com/jcinis/ditherto/blob/main/examples/responsive-demo.js). Worker lifetime belongs to the caller. The gallery includes shared palette/algorithm controls, independent exposures, layout resizing, and original/processed toggling.

## Algorithm behavior

- **Floyd–Steinberg:** left-to-right raster scan; error weights 7/16 right, 3/16 below-left, 5/16 below, 1/16 below-right. Unclamped floating-point error buffers avoid intermediate byte rounding.
- **Atkinson:** six forward neighbors each receive 1/8 of the error; 1/4 is intentionally discarded. The diffusion implementations use only a few rows of scratch memory.
- **Ordered:** a fixed 4×4 Bayer matrix with centered thresholds `(rank + 0.5) / 16`. Black/white follows ordinary intensity thresholding. Arbitrary palettes use a documented extension: find the nearest color, choose the best RGB segment from it to another palette color, and use the threshold to select between them. Exact palette colors remain unchanged. This is deterministic, not randomized noise.

npm run assets:site  # regenerate the real README/site pictures
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:ci       # unit, oracle, golden PNG, real Node I/O and DOM tests

```

Run `node scripts/review-photos.mjs` after building to generate a side-by-side photographic review sheet in `test-results/`. Fixture sources and licenses are recorded in `tests/fixtures/photos/README.md`.

The browser test suite captures desktop/mobile previews in `test-results/`. CI uses the committed lockfile and runs Node 20/22 checks plus Chromium, Firefox and WebKit tests. Photo-palette tests cover real decoding, alpha/population weighting, deterministic output, color budgets and separate reference uploads. Tone tests cover exposure stops, contrast endpoints, reset and Node/browser parity. The photographic corpus covers independent Pillow BOX references, fractional ratios, alpha, JPEG EXIF orientations 2–8, tagged sRGB, and lossless WebP. These checks do not certify arbitrary wide-gamut profiles or every browser/OS decoder.
